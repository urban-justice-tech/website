This website was designed to visualize industrial technology distribution network data and social capital data in Euljiro. It was designed by activists of the Cheonggyecheon Anti-gentrification Alliance and Listen to the City.

Euljiro and Cheoggyecheon is an important place for artists, engineers, and makers to buy materials and make prototypes. However, its existence has been threatened by the redevelopment project of luxury hi-rises. The project began with the idea of how researchers, artists, archivists, activists, scientists, data designers, and local merchants would work together to visualize the value of the space in danger of disappearing. Project participants realized the notable characteristics of this space as largely industrial, historical, and relational values, and established an online space by collecting data to visualize these meanings and discussing how to visualize them with designer Wonyoung So. During the process of production, project participants tried to capture human behavior and the value they create in Eujiro and Cheonggyecheon and thus tried to answer the following questions: What could be the act of archiving as a resistance? How do documents contribute to construct our memories?

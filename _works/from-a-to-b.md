From Point A to Point B generates fictional accounts of real trips taken by real people that exist in public data sets.

From Point A to Point B nods to this data-based attempt to guess the in-between spaces, the fissures of data. However, it also acknowledges the fundamental irreconcilability of data and the world it represents. Instead of trying to render the world into an ‘accurate’ fixed state, we explore the different potential states opened up by the sparsity of data. We take the idea of inventing realities quite literally, creating speculative accounts based on people’s journeys documented in open data sets.

This work is an illustration of data methodologies’ reliance on guesswork and assumptions, which invent numbers where measurements do not exist. At the same time, it is a poetic exploration of people’s experience rendered invisible through its abstraction into numbers. 

From Point A to Point B was made for, exhibited at and supported by Data Through Design 2019.

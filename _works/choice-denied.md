The Housing Choice Voucher program supports over 2.5 million households by subsidizing rent payments within the private housing market. However, challenges arise due to exclusionary practices, undermining the program’s goal of ‘choice.’ Tenant screening practices have been critical in exacerbating these challenges, yet their impact remains understudied. Drawing on tenant screening criteria documents from property management websites and the Survey of Consumer Finances, this study finds that while voucher holders generally meet rent-to-income thresholds due to the subsidies—keeping their rent burden relative to their income, they still face barriers related to credit scores, bankruptcy history, and debt. These criteria, which apply to both voucher and non-voucher renters, may exclude approximately one in ten voucher holders, despite the guaranteed portion of rent covered by public assistance. These findings show an urgent need for policy interventions to the potential exclusionary impacts of tenant screening services.
